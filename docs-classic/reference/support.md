### Support

We provide support via the
[Darklang Community Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite). Darklang
engineers answer questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community
members are also around to offer helpful suggestions.

It is usually helpful to include a link to the handler you're having an issue
with, and possibly also link to a trace that shows the problems, for example:

> `https://darklang.com/a/paul#handler=1641560826&trace=c8183003-d74e-5f1d-bcd7-3be1ee5a1640`

If you click on a handler and a trace, you'll find this URL in the browser's
location bar.

We really appreciate feedback, especially long-form feedback discussing what
your found confusing or where you got stuck. We keep a collection of feedback in
the
[Feedback discussion forum](https://github.com/darklang/dark/discussions/categories/feedback)
-- we would love it if you commented there. If you would prefer to comment
anonymously, you can send it to
[feedback@darklang.com](mailto:feedback@darklang.com).
