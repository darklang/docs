title: Setting up the Darklang repo
---

You can access the Darklang repo at
[https://github.com/darklang/dark](https://github.com/darklang/dark). This is a
monorepo containing the main F# backend, as well as some auxiliary services used
to run the Darklang infrastructure.

- Run through the installation instructions in the
  [README](https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/README.md)
- You should now be running `./scripts/builder --compile --test --watch` and
  seeing a completed build.
