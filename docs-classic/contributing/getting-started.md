_Note that you can also
[contribute without coding](if-you-dont-know-our-stack.md)!_

This guide will get you making your first PR to the Darklang repo. It helps you
set up the repo, write your first test, and make your first pull request. After
that, it will guide you on how to work on bigger things.

As a first step, we recommend joining the [Darklang Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite).
All discussions are in the `#general` room.
