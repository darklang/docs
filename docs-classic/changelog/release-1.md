# Darklang Release 1

In June of 2022, we switched to a "release" schedule where we publish release
notes once a month. Prior to that, release notes were published alolng various
timelines. This page captures all releases before this switch-over.

## Week of 6/12/2020

- Secrets are now available! Now you can store API keys, passwords and other
  sensitive information separately from the rest of your canvas. Secrets will
  appear in autocomplete in handlers across your entire canvas. They will appear

## Week of 5/29/2020

- It's now possible to set a return type for functions. The return type will
  appear in the autocomplete and type errors will be displayed when necessary,
  making it easier to know that your functions work, and making it easier to use
  and understand functions. This means that your functions can also now use the
  Error Rail, if you set their return type to Result or Option.

![changelog/returntypes.png](/img/changelog/returntypes.png)

- Datastores can now have fields named id. This was contributed by our first
  external contributor, [Caleb H](https://github.com/naclcaleb)!

## Week of 5/22/2020

- We've added more information to the sidebar! If you're not sure what a section
  in the sidebar is for, click on its name and more details will appear on the
  right side of your canvas.

![changelog/sidebar.gif](/img/changelog/sidebar.gif)

- We've done some major infrastructure work behind the Cron scheduler, which
  significantly improved its performance. You should now see all Crons,
  including those with a 1 minute interval, running on time again.
- Return values and execution fade are no longer stale when taking functions
  on/off the
  [error rail](https://docs.darklang.com/discussion/error-handling#error-rail)

- We've added a Hello World tutorial that will show automatically for new
  accounts. It can also be accessed via the avatar menu.

![changelog/helloworld.png](/img/changelog/helloworld.png)

- [Package manager functions](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages) and
  their underlying code can now be accessed via the sidebar. These functions
  will appear in the autocomplete, and can be used like any other built-in
  function.

![changelog/packagemanager.png](/img/changelog/packagemanager.png)

- It's now easier to add 404s to your canvas - the entire line is now clickable,
  instead of just the plus sign.
- Made a ton of small fixes to feature flags:
  - The correct docstring now shows when a feature flag is selected
  - Feature flag expressions now show the correct live value
  - Feature flags are now correctly created after pressing `Cmd+a` to select
    everything.
  - Feature flags no longer incorrectly display the "code was not run executed
    in this trace" error message.
- 404s should no longer appear off-screen when added to your canvas.

- Added a [Setting Up OAuth](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-app)
  page to the
  [Building Slack Apps](https://docs.darklang.com/category/walk-throughs)
  section.

## Week of 5/8/2020

- We now have Dark badges for your sites! Add a
  [Made With Dark badge](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/sharing-dark) to
  your apps to establish your early Dark expertise 🎉

![changelog/badge.png](/img/changelog/badge.png)

- Clicking on a link in the sidebar will now always jump you to the correct
  place on the canvas. This was a super annoying bug that we internally referred
  to as "the dreaded positioning bug", and it is finally fixed. A blog post will
  be out describing the horror show behind this next week.
- Copying & pasting now works properly for pipes! We'll no longer lose arguments
  when copying between piped and non-piped expressions.
- Re-ordering function parameters works again. You can drag a function parameter
  to change its order (and we'll reorder the callers too).
- When you invite people (go to Settings), we'll error properly if the invite
  failed.
- When you try to access Dark in Firefox or other browsers, we'll tell you it
  won't work instead of crashing.
- You can now drag much more of a handler to move it (now including the
  docstring and return value boxes)
- When clicking on traces with errors, we'll no longer incorrectly color the
  trace dots.
- `Result::map2` and 5 other `Result` functions now goes to the error rail.
- When you press `,` to add another entry to a list, we'll now support it on
  both sides of an existing `,`.

## Week of 5/1/2020

- We now show you the exact execution path of a trace, making it easy to
  understand what happened in that trace. See which code paths are executed,
  whether `if`s return `true` or `false`, and which patterns are matched. This
  should make it much easier to understand code at a glance.

![changelog/codeexecution.gif](/img/changelog/codeexecution.gif)

- Fixed a bug that caused text to sometimes be selected in multiple handlers.
- It is now possible to drag both the return value and docstring fields on a
  handler.
- We have disabled the visual identifier for error traces, due to them turning
  all trace dots red. We plan to fix and re-enable in the future.

## Week of 4/24/2020

- We've added `Http::setCookie_v2` which handles the `expires` parameter
  properly. It also has much better error messages
- Added `Dict::member`, `Date::<=` and `Date::>=` to the standard library
- Updated a few standard library functions:
  - `String::isSubstring` is now `String::contains`
  - `List::contains` is now `List::member`
- `String::contains` is now supported in `DB::query*` functions
- It is now no longer possible to create multiple datastores with the same name.
- Fixed an issue that causes Dark to crash when selecting while the autocomplete
  was available.
- We now support recursion! While it's been supported for a long time on the
  backend, you were unable to get live values for recursive functions in the
  editor. Now you can!
- When new traces are created while your editor is open, we'll now replace old
  traces with the new one (before we added all traces, which caused large
  canvases to crash).
- We've improved the loading time of the editor for apps with lots of 404s
- Some function docstrings now link to relevant documentation - more to come!

### Documentation

- Improved the documentation around
  [setting up a custom domain](https://docs.darklang.com/how-to/custom-domains)
- Added a tutorial around
  [creating new Asana projects and tasks via Slack](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-asana)

## Week of 4/17/2020

- Traces can now be linked to directly.
- Pasting JSON into Dark now works in more cases
- The command palette keyboard shortcut has changed: you should now use `ctrl+s`
  (we also support `alt+x`, and `ctrl+\`, should it be helpful for folks with
  non-US keyboard)
- Updated `String::slugify_v1` to slugify correctly in all cases.
- `DB::query` functions now support `String::contains` in their query block.
- The docstrings for `List::sortBy` and `List::sortByComparator` were updated to
  improve clarity.
- Fixed the return type for `DB::queryOne` - it now correctly returns an
  `Option`, and works properly with the error rail
- Fixed a bug with selecting dicts in feature flags
- [darklang.com](http://darklang.com) now displays properly on Safari

### Package Manager

  [Mailchimp subscribe function](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages#mailchimp-package)

### Documentation

- Lots of small typos and corrections were made - thank you to everyone who
  reported them!
- Improved the documentation around `match`, thanks to Nathan Lloyd Smith!
- Added a tutorial around
  [creating new Trello cards via Slack](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-trello)

## Week of 4/10/2020

- We've done a lot of work to improve how quickly we can set up custom domains -
  if you want a custom domain to point to your Dark app,
  [read the documentation](https://docs.darklang.com/how-to/custom-domains) to
  see how to do it.
- More standard library functions! We're ramping down our concentrated effort to
  add more all at once, so if you have any requests post in the
  [Community Chat](https://darklang.com/discord-invite) or email
  feedback@darklang.com
  - `Float::clamp`
  - `Int::clamp`
  - `Int::mod`
  - `Int::remainder`
  - `String::dropFirst`
  - `String::dropLast`
  - `String::first`
  - `String::last`
  - `String::trimStart`
  - `String::trimEnd`
- We've realized that people had difficulty knowing that they need traces when
  they're editing functions, so we've added some in-editor pointers to it (call
  the function from elsewhere!)

  ![changelog/functions.png](/img/changelog/Apr10/functions.png)

- We're working a lot on performance of the editor, especially when typing.
  We've optimized a lot of different parts of the app, mostly related to typing
  and changing code, some of which are 3x faster. We'll continue working on
  this.
- The Dark CLI now suggests some common problems and solutions when auth fails,
  in response to a few instances of shell string handling surprising users
- Bug fix: typing an infix operator will now always open autocomplete.
- Bug fix: `extract-variable` now works correctly with right to left selection.
- Worker names no longer allow quotes - we noticed this causing ambiguity
  between sending and receiving of messages
- Updated the return type for `db::queryOne`

### Documentation

- Added a separate section to the documentation for
  [Building Slack Apps](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-app)
- Added a tutorial for
  [building a slack app that checks for new channels and posts them](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-channel-check)
- Added and documented many
  [Trello package manager functions](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages#trello-package)

## Week of 4/3/2020

  - `Math::sinh`
  - `Math::tanh`
- We've done a redesign of the sidebar to be more consistent and prettier!

![changelog/sidebar.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/sidebar.png)

- The `add-feature-flag` option in the command palette is now context aware
- The feature flag panel is now auto-focused when adding a new feature flag
- Added an autocomplete option for `OPTIONS` in HTTP. This is especially useful
  for people doing preflight requests as part of `CORS`

![changelog/option.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/option.png)

- Made it clearer that return values apply specifically to a trace

![changelog/returntext.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/returntext.png)

- Adding a function at the start of a pipe now works properly (before this, we
  lost the first argument)
- Text selection has been reworked and should work a lot better and have fewer
  bugs. In particular, double-clicking on a function name properly selects the
  function, and selecting with the mouse now works in all cases (that we could
  find!)
- Typing "." to make a field now always works, even if the autocomplete isn't
  ready
- Bug fix: double-clicking in text boxes now keeps your cursor there
- Bug fix: in a `match` with a `Just` pattern, the variable now has the right
  type in autocomplete
- `Error:toString` has been deprecated (you can't call functions on type errors)

### Documentation

  [Slack package manager functions](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages#slack)

## Week of 3/27/2020

We released a lot this week, hope you enjoy!

- We have re-released feature flags! Feature flags allow you change live code
  safely: write the new code that you want, choose the condition to use that
  code instead (just for your user? just if a header is passed? Just if a
  particular query string is provided?). Then switch to the new code or discard
  it, safely, without breaking anything.
- Feature flags can be created from the command palette.

![changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png](/img/changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png)

- The keyboard shortcut for the command palette has changed to `Ctrl-\`

![changelog/Mar27/2020-03-27_12.27.23.gif](/img/changelog/Mar27/2020-03-27_12.27.23.gif)

- We've added a ton of standard library functions:
  - `Date::weekday`
  - `Dict::toList`
  - `Dict::fromList`

### Documentation

- Added
  [Your First Function](https://docs.darklang.com/tutorials/extract-function)
  and
  [Your First External API Call](https://docs.darklang.com/tutorials/call-external-api)
- Updated the
  [Slack tutorial](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-app) to discuss
  OAuth v2

## Week of 3/20/2020

- Now you can give us more information about your Dark projects, and let us know
  if they're live. This helps us understand how we can make Dark better for you!

![changelog/Mar20/about.png](/img/changelog/Mar20/about.png)

- Significantly faster HTTP requests and canvas loading. We "fixed" this a few
  weeks ago, but only saw modest improvements. Yeah, there was a bug. So now
  it's fixed fixed: some HTTP requests have dropped from 3s to 70ms.
- We've added lots of standard library functions:

  - `Float::absoluteValue`
  - `Float::negate`
  - `Float::power`
  - `Float::min`
  - `Float::max`
  - `Float::truncate`

    ![changelog/Mar20/float.png](/img/changelog/Mar20/float.png)

  - `Int::negate`
  - `Int::absoluteValue`
  - `Dict::isEmpty`
  - `String::isEmpty`
  - `Date::weekday`
  - `Bool::xor`

## Week of 3/13/2020

### Features

- We now tell you how to deal with the ErrorRail in the docstrings for functions
  that returns `Options` and `Results`

![changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png)

- We've started narrowing down the types in the autocomplete using types, and we
  now have some nice error messages for options which don't match the types

![changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png)

- `DB::query` (and other `DB::query` functions) now support `Date` operations
- Performance: We've improved the load speed of your code on our servers by
  about 3x over the last few weeks, with the final change landing this week.
  This has the largest impact when loading the editor as all of your code loads
  then (though it is also less noticeable there as the JS overhead is higher
  than the DB overhead so 🤷🏽‍♀️)
- We have launched an alpha
  [package manager](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages), which allows
  re-using Dark functions from other users or canvases. Today, only Dark
  employees can add functions to the package manager. We've started with some
  commonly used Slack functions, but let us know via chat or email if you have
  any requests - or your own functions you'd like to share.

![changelog/Mar13/slackfunctions.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/slackfunctions.png)

- When you try to use invalid canvas names (e.g. with capital letters), we now
  error much better
