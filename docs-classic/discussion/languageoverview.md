Darklang isn't just a language. It's a combination of the language, editor,
framework, and infrastructure. When writing code in Darklang, you can run
functions, and wait to handle errors. Many aspects that would be not considered
"language" in other environments are part of Darklang.

Darklang also includes HTTP libraries for interacting with external APIs, a
package manager to make that even easier, and built in functionality for
datastores.

### Functional

Darklang is a statically-typed functional/imperative hybrid, based loosely on
ML. Darklang has implicit returns, and makes heavy use of pipelines and
functions like `List::map`

### More Details

Darklang is somewhat similar to OCaml or Elm. It has many similarities to Rust
and Haskell, and is also influenced by Clojure, Ruby, Python, CoffeeScript, as
well as our experience with (alphabetically) Bash, C, Clojure, CoffeeScript,
C++, Elm, Javascript, Java, Haskell, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, ReasonML,
Ruby/Rails, React, and Rust.
