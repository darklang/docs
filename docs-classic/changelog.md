While we continuously deliver features as they're written, we like to
[package up the work](https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-release-schedule/) into
monthly changelogs, which we call "Releases".

- [Release 8](changelog/release-8.md) - November, 2022
- [Release 7](changelog/release-7.md) - October, 2022
- [Release 6](changelog/release-6.md) - September, 2022
- [Release 5](changelog/release-5.md) - August, 2022
- [Release 4](changelog/release-4.md) - July, 2022
- [Release 3](changelog/release-3.md) - June, 2022
- [Release 2](changelog/release-2.md) - June 6, 2022

Prior to June 2022, we published release notes along various timelines.
