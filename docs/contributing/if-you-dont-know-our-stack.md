title: If you don't know our stack (F#)
---

F# can be a little bit daunting, but even if you don't know them, there are a
bunch of ways to get involved.

## Other languages

Darklang has a number of different languages, including Rust, bash, Python,
Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

We have issues in each of these:

- [Javascript](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ajavascript)
- [Bash](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abash)

## Non-code

Lots of times we don't know what to do, and it's extremely valuable to have
someone look into the problem and document what's happening. These issues are
labeled
["investigation"](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ainvestigation).

Similar, the
"[needs thought](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aneeds-thought)"
issue is about designing thoughtful solutions to sticky problems.

## Writing docs

There are lots of docs that would be very helpful to write. If you look at the
[current docs](https://darklang.com/docs), there are docs that would be useful
that you can write as a non-expert.

There are a bunch of [tutorials](https://docs.darklang.com/category/tutorial)
for different technologies, frameworks and libraries; writing one for another
would be extremely useful. It would also allow you to write up how Darklang
could be improved to support that technology. You can even make
[video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/Darklang/videos)!

Similarly, we have some guides for people learning Darklang who know other
languages. Adding another language would be wonderful. See for example the
[Python version](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/cheatsheets/python-cheatsheet).

## Reporting bugs

Darklang has many bugs and problems: documenting them for other contributors to
fix would be very useful. Small, compact descriptions with instructions to
reproduce the bugs are very welcome. You can add them to the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues).

### Fluid editor

The "fluid" editor is how you write code in Darklang. It is still often the case
that you get an unexpected result when you type something: documenting
individual cases as issues is very valuable!

### Better error messages

Darklang's error messages are not as good as they could be, and this is a real
problem for users learning the language the first time. Documenting a bad error
message, especially with a suggested better version, is a really useful
contribution.

## Learning F\#

Darklang is almost everybody's first F# project. So if you don't know these two
similar languages, join the club - we all learned as we contributed to Darklang.
Fortunately, they are very similar to Darklang.

There are a number of resources to help as well:

- [A guided walkthrough of making your first PR](adding-your-first-test.md)
- [good first bugs](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-bug)
  assume you don't know anything about F#

Also, some bugs, especially our
[initiatives](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ainitiative),
require almost no F# knowledge, despite the fact that they are in those parts of
the codebase. People with no prior exposure to them should be able to make a
useful change to one of these in very little time.
