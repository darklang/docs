title: F# for Dark developers
---

This guide aims to introduce you to enough F# contribute to Dark, assuming you
already know Dark.

## Some simple F\# code

Dark and F# are very similar. Here's an example function in F#:

```fsharp
let someFunction (intArgument : int) : string =
  let aString = "myString"
  let anInt = 65 + intArgument
  let aFloat = 6.72
  anotherFunction aString anInt aFloat
```

This is a function called `someFunction`, which takes one argument, an `int`
called `intArgument`, and returns a `string`. Three variables are defined in the
body, first a string, then an int, then a float, and finally we call the
`anotherFunction` function with all three parameters as arguments.

In Dark this would be written:

```fsharp
someFunction
  intArgument : Int
  â†ª String

let aString = "myString"
let anInt = 65 + intArgument
let aFloat = 6.72
anotherFunction aString anInt aFloat
```

In ReScript this would be written:

```rescript
let someFunction = (intArgument: int) : string =>
  let aString = "myString"
  let anInt = 65 + intArgument
  let aFloat = 6.72
  anotherFunction(aString, anInt, aFloat)
```

As you can see, the syntaxes are very similar.

## Dark vs F\# vs ReScript

Dark, ReScript, and F# are all influenced by OCaml. Though Dark is currently a
subset of these languages, Dark will continue to grow some more of their
features. We'll discuss the similarities and differences as we go through
language features.

### Types

ReScript/F# are strongly typed-languages. Dark aspires to be, but it doesn't
have a type-checker yet. This shows the biggest difference in between working in
these languages, that the compiler will refuse to compile if the types are
wrong.

ReScript/F# have type-inference, which means that the compiler will try and
figure out what the types are. This is frequently the source of bad compiler
messages, often it will tell you something which seems wrong because it guessed
wrong about certain types.

Usually type errors actually contain useful information, but they need to be
read very carefully to find it.

We've found the best way to debug incorrect types is to add type annotations to
everything. We add them to all functions (we didn't always do this, but we do
now, but we are now), including all parameters and return types (see
[example](#functions) below).

In F#, you can actually add types in many places where they aren't required,
such as variable definitions:

```fsharp
let y = 6.7
let (x : int) = 6
x + 5
```

`x` here, despite being a normal variable definition, has a type signature. F#
and ReScript allow this in many places, and it's useful for tracking down these
errors.

We'll discuss declaring types below.

### Functions

Functions in ReScript and F# are defined in the outer scope. Type signatures are
optional but we always use them:

```fsharp
let myFunction (arg1 : int) (arg2 : string) : string =
  if arg1 < (String.toInt arg2)
  then "just return a string"
  else arg2
```

Here, `myFunction` has two arguments, `arg1` and `arg2`, which are an `int` and
`string` respectively. It returns a `string`.

Like in Dark, the body of a function is just an expression, and it automatically
returns the result of that expression.

(see [below](#advanced-functions) for more details on functions in OCaml)

### Standard library

Most of the code in Dark uses
[Tablecloth](https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth), which has the same
interface for ReScript and F#.

Note: for implementing the standard libraries, we do not use Tablecloth as it is
still pretty new and may be in flux. Instead, we try to make sure that we use
libraries from `.NET`, FSharp.Core, or if necessary, the FSharpPlus library.

### Int

An `int` is the same in Dark and F#, same syntax, same meaning. Note that ints
are 31-bit in ReScript, 32-bit in F#, and 64-bit in Dark.

```fsharp
let x = 5
x + 6
```

### Float

A `float` is the same in Dark, ReScript, and F#, both of them are 64-bit
floating point numbers.

Like in Dark, there are special operators to work on floats in ReScript.

```fsharp
let x = 0.1
x +. 0.3
```

To convert from floats to ints use `Float.toInt`, or `Float.round`.

In F#, standard operators work on floats too.

```fsharp
let x = 0.1 in
x +. 0.3
```

### Bool

Like in Dark, `bool`s in F# and ReScript are either `true` or `false`.

### String

Strings are Unicode in Dark, ReScript and F#. While you're unlikely to hit
differences in practice, they do actually use a different in-memory
representation, with Dark using UTF-8, ReScript using the browser's built-in
UCS-2, and F# using .NET's UTF-16 (which is very similar but not quite the same
as UCS-2).

```fsharp
let myString = "some string, escaping is allowed\nwhich dark doesn't support yet" in
myString
```

### String Interpolation

Both ReScript and F# support string interpolation. In F#:

```fsharp
let x = 6
let y = 7.8
let myString = $"some string with x: {x} and also {y}"
```

In ReScript:

```rescript
let x = 6
let y = 7.8
let myString = {j|some string with x: $x and also $y|j}
```

Dark does not currently support String interpolation.

### List

Lists in Dark, F# and ReScript are almost the same. In F#, lists use `;` as
separators, like so:

```fsharp
[1; 2; 3; 4]
```

If ReScript, the syntax is:

```rescript
list{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

(However, F# allows separators to be omitted which the list elements are lined
up vertically, as it uses indentation as the separator).

While Dark technically allows you to create lists that have different types in
them (which you should not do), ReScript and F# emphatically do not.

To type check a list in ReScript, you specify its type like so: `int list`,
which is a list of ints. In F#, you use `List<int>` (though `int list` is still
allowed).

### Records

Records are mostly used as objects are in most languages. Like Dark, they only
have fields, not methods, and you use functions to manipulate them.

A record in ReScript will look quite familiar:

```rescript
{ field1: 56,
  field2: true,
  field3: "asd"

```

F# uses a similar syntax, but with `=` instead of `:`, though it allows you to
use indentation instead of separators:

```fsharp
{
  field1 = 56
  field2 = true
  field3 = "asd"
}
```

Note that they use `=` to connect a field and a value, and `;` as row separator.
The types of the fields do not have to be declared.

Records are immutable, like almost everything in ReScript/F#, and are updated
using unusual syntaxes:

In ReScript:

```rescript
let x = { field1 = 56; field2 = true } in
let updatedX = {...x, field1: 57 } in
doSomethingWith(updatedX)
```

In F#:

```fsharp
let x = { field1 = 56; field2 = true }
let updatedX = { x with field1 = 57 }
doSomethingWith updatedX
```

Note that records in Dark are really dictionaries, which is why you update them
with `Dict::set`. We're trying to figure out how to split records and
dictionaries apart better in Dark, after which they will be more like
ReScript/F# (though hopefully with better syntax).

Type definitions for records look like this in F#:

```fsharp
type Person =
  {
    name : string
  ; age : int
  }
```

and like this in ReScript:

```rescript
type person = {
  name: string,
  age: int
}
```

### Let

`let`s in ReScript and F# are the same as in Dark:

```fsharp
let x = 45
x + 23
```

`let` also allow destructing in ReScript/F#, although we don't currently use
that very often.

### If

`if` statements in F#/OCaml are extremely similar to Dark, including that they
only allow `bool`s as the condition, and in their syntax.

In F#:

```fsharp
if hasAccess user
then "Welcome!"
else "Access denied"
```

In ReScript:

```rescript
if hasAccess(user) {
  "Welcome!"
} else {
  "Access denied"
}
```

### Operators

F# has some unusual operators. Most importantly, the equality operator is `=`
(that's just one equals sign), whereas in most languages it's `==` (including
Dark and ReScript). `=` is very strict equality, equivalent to `===` in
languages that have that, such as JS.

F# also has a `==` operator, but you should never use it.

F# use `<>` for inequality (`!=` in Dark and ReScript). In ReScript, most of the
comparison operators (such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, etc) only operate on integers, and
not on floats. In F#, they work on both ints and floats.

### Match

Dark has a `match` statement that is very similar to F#/ReScript, with slightly
different syntax. In Dark you write:

```fsharp
match myValue
  Some x -> 5
  _ -> 6
```

while in F# you write

```fsharp
match myValue with
| Some x -> 5
| _ -> 6
```

Notice the `with` keyword, and starting the patterns with `|`.

In ReScript you write:

```rescript
switch myValue {
| Some(x) -> 5
| _ -> 6
}
```

F#/ReScript also support more powerful `match`es, for example multiple patterns
can match a single branch:

```rescript
match myValue with
| 4 | 5 | 6 -> "between 4 and 6"
| _ -> "not between 4 and 6"
```

F# also supports the `when` clause:

```fsharp
match myValue with
| Some myInt when myInt >= 4 && myInt <= 6 -> "between 4 and 6"
| _ -> "not between 4 and 6"
```

This is called an `if` in ReScript:

```rescript
switch myValue {
| Some(myInt) if myInt >= 4 && myInt <= 6 -> "between 4 and 6"
| _ -> "not between 4 and 6"
}
```

Be careful of very subtle bugs when combining multiple patterns with `when`
clauses: the entire pattern will fail if the pattern matches when the clause
does not:

```rescript
let myValue = Some 5
match myValue with
| Some 4 | Some myInt when myValue <> Some 4 -> "this will never succeed"
| _ -> "this will succeed as a fallback"
```

### Variants

Dark has a handful of enums for `Option` and `Result` types: `Just`, `Nothing`,
`Ok` and `Error`. In the future we will expand this to allow user-defined types
as well.

ReScript/F# support the `Option` and `Result` types and we use them a lot.
However, the constructors for Option are named differently; both languages use:
`Some` and `None` instead of `Just` and `Nothing`.

These enums are typically called "variants". We use them frequently, especially
to represent expressions. For example in `FluidExpression.fs`:

```fsharp
type t =
  | EInteger of id * string
  | EBool of id * bool
  | EString of id * string
  | EFloat of id * string * string
  | ENull of id
  | EBlank of id
  | ELet of id * string * t * t
  | EIf of id * t * t * t
  | EBinOp of id * string * t * t * sendToRail
  | ELambda of id * (analysisID * string) list * t
  | EFieldAccess of id * t * string
  | EVariable of id * string
  | EFnCall of id * string * t list * sendToRail
  | EPartial of id * string * t
  | ERightPartial of id * string * t
  | ELeftPartial of Shared.id * string * t
  | EList of id * t list
  | ERecord of id * (string * t) list
  | EPipe of id * t list
  | EConstructor of id * string * t list
  | EMatch of id * t * (FluidPattern.t * t) list
  | EPipeTarget of id
  | EFeatureFlag of id * string * t * t * t
```

Type `t` (it's a common convention to name the main type of a module `t`) must
be one of `EInteger`, `EBool`, `EString`, etc. `EInteger` takes two parameters,
an `id` and a `string` (we use a string to represent integers as ReScript
doesn't have a big enough integer type).

To create a `t`, you'd do something like this:

```fsharp
let expr = EInteger (id, "test")
```

To get values from them, you pattern match:

```fsharp
match expr with
| EInteger (_, str) -> str
| _ -> "not an int"
```

### Lambdas

ReScript and F# support lambdas and we use them frequently. They have a
different syntax to Dark, F# uses:

```fsharp
list
|> List.map (fun elem -> elem + 2)
```

and ReScript uses:

```rescript
list->List.map((elem) => elem + 2)
```

It's very common to use functions like `List.map` which have a parameter called
`f` which take a lambda. In F#, above, that parameter is passed like any other.
In ReScript, those parameters are passed as labeled variables:

```rescript
list->List.map:(~f=((elem) => elem + 2))
```

### Pipes

Both languages have pipes which are the same as in Dark. In Dark, the passed
argument goes into the first position. That is also true in ReScript, but not in
F#, where it goes into the last position. As a result, we tend to put the
"subject" of the function in the pipeable position (first in Dark and ReScript,
last in F#). **Note that ReScript uses to have to pipe into the last position
but now does first by default; much of our code was designed to work pipe-last,
instead of pipe-first, and we'll need to migrate to pipe-first.**

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries (hash-maps, etc) are typically called `Map` in F#/ReScript. In
ReScript, they are slightly challenging to use, which is one reason you won't
see them used as much as they really should be.

### Unit

F#/ReScript have a `unit` type, whose only member is `()`. That's an actual
value, for example, all this is valid code:

```fsharp
let falseVar = () != () in
```

It's typically used to pass to a function which is impure but doesn't have any
meaningful arguments, such as `gid ()` (which generates IDs).

### Error handling

Typically we use `Result` or `Option`s for error handling. You'll very commonly
see something like

```fsharp
let isRailable (m : model) (name : string) =
  m.functions
  |> Functions.find name
  |> Option.map (fun fn ->
         fn.fnReturnTipe = TOption || fn.fnReturnTipe = TResult)
  |> Option.withDefault false
```

To find out if a function goes on the error rail, we search for a function,
which returns an Option. We then use a `map` to operate on the option, and
finally choose a default in case the Option returned `None`.

#### Exceptions

F# and ReScript also have exceptions - we hardly use them in the client, but
unfortunately use them a little bit on the backend, which we'd like to do less
of.

Unfortunately, it's hard to tell when an exception could be thrown.

### Imperative programming

F# and ReScript support imperative programming which Dark does not support yet.

In ReScript there are mutable values called refs, that can be updated:

```rescript
let myString = ref("old value")
myString := "new value"; // update contents of myString
print_endline(myString.contents)
```

F# has mutable values that it prefers to refs (it has refs, but they're
deprecated). Mutable values are used like so:

```fsharp
let mutable myString = "old value"
myString <- "new value"
print(myString)
```

### Async/Tasks

For functions that perform IO, you'll need to use the `ply` or `task`
"computation expression". A "computation expression" is a special F# language
feature for writing abstractions with a nice syntax. The `ply` CE allows using a
specialized asynchronous structure called Ply (which is extremely similar to a
.Net Task) easily, and can best be illustrated with an example:

```fsharp
  (function
  | state, [ DObj value; DStr key; DDB dbname ] ->
      uply {
        let db = state.dbs.[dbname]
        let! _id = UserDB.set state true db key value
        return DObj value
      }
  | _ -> incorrectArgs ())
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- `uply {`: this creates the CE, whose return value will be a `Ply<'any>`.
- `let db = state.dbs.[dbname]` - this is just regular F# code
- `let! _id = UserDB.set state true db key value` - the special thing here is
  the `let!` - this line calls `UserDB.set`, a function which returns a `Ply`,
  and unwraps the `Ply`. This means that `_id` can be treated as a normal value
  for the rest of this `taskv`.
- `return DObj value` - return takes an ordinary value and turns it into a
  `Ply`, in this case a `Ply<Dval>`.

Why do we go through all this trouble? Because this is an async runtime, and
`let!` and `return` are the enablers of the asynchronicity. A `Ply` is a
promise, and `let!` waits for the promise and then continues (running other code
while the IO is still pending). This is the exact same as the `async` keyword in
JS, Rust, C# or Python.

Note that while we primarily use `Ply` and `uply` inside the Interpreter, most
of our other async code use `Task` and `task`. These are interchangeable except
that Tasks are a little slower.

### Advanced functions

#### Named parameters

ReScript Functions support named parameters, which you might see called like
this (note the `~`):

```rescript
Option.withDefault(~default=5, Some(5)))
```

These are useful as a named parameter can be placed in any order (this is also
useful for piping).

You declare functions with named parameters like so:

```rescript
let myFunction = (regularParamter : int, ~namedParam : string) : int =>
  ...body of function...
```

These are not in F# or Dark.

#### Optional parameters

ReScript also supports optional parameters, which F# and OCaml do not.

```rescript
let myFunction = (?optionalParam=3, regularParamter : int) : int =
  ...body of function...
```

#### the `rec` and `and` keywords

By default, F#/ReScript functions are not recursive: they cannot call
themselves. To allow a function to call itself, add the `rec` keyword:

```fsharp
let rec myFunction (var : int) : int =
  if var > 6 then 6
  else myFunction (var + 2)
```

Similarly, if two functions need to call each other, they need to be aware of
each other (F#/ReScript programs require all functions to be defined before they
are used). The `and` keyword allows this:

```fsharp
let firstFunction (var : int) =
  (secondFunction var) + 2

and secondFunction (var : int) =
  if var > 6
  then firstFunction 0
  else firstFunction (var + 1)
```

#### Partial application / currying

Occasionally you'll see a function called with fewer arguments than it has
parameters:

```fsharp
let myFunction (param1: int) (param2 : string) =
  ...body...

let myOtherFunction = myFunction 6
```

This is called "partial application", in that the function is only partially
called (this is often called _Currying_ in the functional language community).
This just means that some parameters are filled in, and you now have a function
which can be called with the remaining parameters:

```fsharp
let () =
  myOtherfunction "final argument"
```

This is the same as if it were defined as:

```fsharp
let myOtherFunction (param : string) =
  myFunction 6 param
```

### Modules

ReScript has a complex module system, which takes some time to grasp. Modules
can have parameters, have inheritance, and each other these features uses a
complicated, difficult to grasp syntax.

We only barely use modules in the Dark codebase, so here's what you need to
know:

- all files are automatically modules. Note that in the backend, modules need to
  have their directory names included, but not in the client.

- using a module is simple:

```rescript
open MyModule1 (* all function and types are available *)
module M = MyModule2 (* access members as if the module was called M *)

let x = MyModule3.myFunction 6
```

- the syntax of creating a module is also straightforward:

```rescript
module MyModule = struct
  type t = int
  let myfunction x = x + 2
end
```

We typically `open` the `Prelude` and `Types` modules at the top of all files
(which in turn open other modules, like `Tablecloth` on the client).

F# does have modules, but it does not support any of the complex stuff that
ReScript does.

### Classes and Objects

ReScript supports traditional object oriented programming, though it's not used
very much and very discouraged. The only place we really use it for interacting
with JS (the ReScript JS interop code compiles it to direct OO in JS).

F# has OO that is used to interact with .NET types, and call C# libraries. We do
not use it very much but we do use it some. Defining a method:

```fsharp
type Pos =
  { x : int
  ; y : int
  }
  member this.JustXPlease() = this.x
  override member this.ToString() = $"{this.x}
```

## Dark's codebase history

Dark's backend was originally written in OCaml, and then ported to F# in
2021/2022. A lot of code is written the way it is because that made sense in
OCaml, especially code with the comment `// CLEANUP` in it.

Dark's frontend was originally written in Elm, before being ported. It was
ported to what is now ReScript in 2018. ReScript is the new name (as of 2020)
for what was sometimes called Bucklescript and sometimes called ReasonML. You
may see references to Bucklescript in our codebase (including the prefix "bs").
