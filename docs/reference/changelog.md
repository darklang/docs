## 2021-2022

We have been doing a major rewrite of our backend, moving from OCaml to F#. This
solves significant operational issues and opens Dark to a lot of improvements
and productivity fixes down the line, especially relying more heavily on our
cloud provider.

As we prepare to release the new version, we want to give advanced warning about
some changes to the language and standard library. Though Dark was designed to
avoid changes to existing functionality, allowing for new versions of the
language and standard library to be opted-in, we have not built that part of the
procuct, and given the relatively low usage of Dark we felt the tradeoff was not
worth it yet.

Almost all of these changes are small - we triaged each change individually to
determine if we could avoid it, and what the cost of the change was. We would
like users to be aware of the changes and to change their Dark programs
appropriately to handle them, if possible. Please feel free to discuss the
changes with us to see what we can do to mitigate them for you, or if you know
some other ways to avoid the problem.

_The list below is organized by date discovered, to allow you know when new
things have been added to the list since you last checked._

## Discovered before Feb 28, 2022:

We have changed the execution engine in the Darklang editor (used when editing
on darklang.com or in the Desktop Client). If you experience any issues, you can
revert to the old execution enginer using the `use-ocaml-analysis=true` query
param, (eg `https://darklang.com/a/CANVASNAME?use-ocaml-analysis=true`). In the
Darklang Desktop application, you can open the JS console and run
`window.DarkAnalysis.useOcaml = true`). We are aware of some performance issues,
and will be working on these in the future.

## Discovered before Jan 10, 2022:

### Generating JSON

We have changed how JSON is generated in many cases. All the JSON generated by
Dark is now standards compliant, which is not true of the old version of Dark.
It also uses different formatting. These specific cases are known:

- We no longer generate invalid JSON for the Float values `NaN`, `Infinity` and
  `-Infinity`. The old version of Dark generates them as bare identifiers, while
  the new version puts them in a string (eg `NaN` vs `"NaN"`).

We generate JSON in the following situations:

- when responding to a HTTP request in the HTTP framework
- when making a request with HttpClient (any version)
- when calling any of:
  - `Dict::toJson_v0`
  - `Object::toJson_v1` (_deprecated_)
  - `Object::toJson_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `Twilio::sendText_v1`
  - `Twilio::sendText_v0` (_deprecated_)

Note that the following `JWT` functions do not use this new behaviour, and
should have the exact same behaviour as before, including:

- `JWT::signAndEncode_v0` (_deprecated_)
- `JWT::signAndEncode_v1`
- `JWT::signAndEncodeWithHeaders_v0` (_deprecated_)
- `JWT::signAndEncodeWithHeaders_v1`

### Parsing JSON

When parsing JSON, we no longer accept the following invalid JSON:

- bare field names, such as in `{ id : 5 }`. You need to quote field names:
  `{ "id": 5 }`
- newlines and invalid bytes in JSON strings
- the bare identifiers `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are no longer parsed
  into valid floats (note that the old version of Dark might have generated JSON
  with these values in it)

Dark now also allows 64-bit integers (as opposed to 63-bit integers before).

Dark parses JSON:

- when receiving a HTTP request in the HTTP framework
- when receiving a response to a request made with HttpClient (any version)
- when calling any of:

  - `JSON::parse_v1`
  - `JSON::parse_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `JSON::read_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `JSON::read_v0` (_deprecated_)

Note that `JWT::verifyAndExtract_v0` and `JWT::verifyAndExtract_v1` are not
affected by this change, as they have been kept deliberately compatible with the
old versions.

## Discovered before Dec 29, 2021:

- Cronjobs will no longer double-fire during a deployment of Dark code

- Dark used to return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in lower-case, it
  is now returned in mixed case.

## Discovered before Oct 1, 2021:

- When making a web request to your Dark application, if you did not specific a
  'user-agent' header, Dark used to add a 'user-agent' header of
  'ocaml-cohttp/1.2.0'. We no longer add this header.

- When making a web request to your Dark application with a 'content-type'
  header of "text/ping", Dark used to ignore the code and immediately return a
  response of status code 418. It now processes the request instead.

## Discovered before Aug 30, 2021:

### Standard library

- `HttpClient::*` functions no longer support making requsts with arbitrary
  `Content-Type`s. They must now be
  [valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type),
  for example `"application/json"` or `"application/json; charset=utf-8"`.

- `HttpClient::*` functions called with usernames and passwords in the url can
  now support arbitrary UTF8 (in the past, emoji (etc) was not supported.)

## Discovered before Aug 5, 2021:

### Standard library

- `X509::pemCertificatePublicKeys` used to only work for RSA keys. It now also
  supports DSA and ECDsa keys. The old version would read ECDsa keys and return
  an incorrect answer - it now returns a correct answer.

## Discovered before July 16, 2021:

### Standard library

- `String.toLowercase` and `String::toUppercase` worked correctly in the old
  version of Dark, for all unicode. In the new version, the library we are using
  does not correctly handle some case changes, instead keeping the original
  character. This happens when the replacement is a different length than the
  character being replaced (for example, `"և"` should be `"ԵՒ"` when converted
  to upper case, which the old version did correctly and the new version does
  not). We are considering fixing this before shipping, please let us know if
  this would be a problem for you.

- `String::split` would fail if the 2nd argument was `""` and the first argument
  was a complex Unicode character, such as `String::split "👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍👩‍👧‍👦🏳️‍⚧️‍️🇵🇷" ""`.
  This is now split properly.

- Functions whose output relies on the internal ordering of a `Dict` may have
  different outputs, specifically, the output Lists may be in a different order.
  Examples include `Dict::keys`, `Dict::values`, and `Dict::toList` which return
  `List`s of values which are ordered based on the internal ordering in the
  original `Dict`.

- When calling `List::uniqueBy`, and there is a duplicate, the new version of
  Dark may pick a different value for the duplicate. For example:

```dark
List.uniqueBy_v0 [1;2;3;4] (fun x -> Int.divide_v0 x 2) = [ 1, 3, 4 ] // old Dark
List.uniqueBy_v0 [1;2;3;4] (fun x -> Int.divide_v0 x 2) = [ 1, 2, 4 ] // new Dark
```

- `String.trim`, `String::trimEnd` and `String::trimStart` worked incorrectly in
  some Unicode situations, they now work correctly.

### Error messages

All error messages have been renovated, attempting to make them more consistent
and to reuse error message machinery. As a result, a majority of Dark error
messages have changed. If you were relying on the explicit format of a Dark
language or stdlib error message, expect that it will be different.

If you do any error handling which relies specifically on the text of an error
message coming from Dark, we recommend you no longer do that, and just use the
presence of the error instead of the text.

There are two places in Dark which use string error messages:

#### `Result.Error`s

The `Error` enum (referred to as `Result.Error` below for clarity), will contain
a string error in most cases, which you might be using directly or indirectly.

You might be accessing `Result.Error`s and their text contents directly using
the `match` statement.

You might also be accessing their text contents indirectly, using `toString`, or
other stringifying functions, such as `toString`, `JSON::` functions and
`HTTPClient::` functions. This is only true if you taken the function returning
the `Result.Error` off the error rail. This text may also make it to your
web/mobile clients or API consumers.

`Result.Error`s returned via a HTTP handler are not presented to the user, so
text cannot leak that way.

#### Runtime errors

Runtime errors (including type errors) are not accessible via Dark programs, and
will always terminate the Dark program when they are accessed. As a result, the
text of any runtime error should not be accessible to your programs or your
users.

### HTTP stack

Dark has switched to using Kestrel, a high-performance HTTP server from .NET,
for its HTTP server. There are some differences between the new Kestrel-based
server and the previous OCaml `cohttp`-based server:

Large differences:

- Dark programs can no longer set the HTTP `Content-Length` header and it will
  be set automatically. A `content-length` header will be ignored if provided
  via `Http::response` or similar functions.
- JSON returned from HTTP requests is now formatted differently

Minor differences:

- When making HTTP requests to Dark:
  - Clients must send at least 256 bytes every 5 seconds or be timed-out
  - All headers must be sent in first 10 seconds
  - There must be fewer than 100 headers and they must fit in 32KB
  - The maximum size of HTTP requests to Dark is 10MB
- Http responses sent by Dark
  - Headers will be returned in a different order
  - Headers are not always lowercase anymore
  - The `Date` header is now always present
  - The `Server` header is now `darklang` and always present

## Improvements in the 2021 rewrite

These are being updated below as we remember them, and will be rewritten into a
changelog when they ship.

- The Dark implementation is now asynchronous, meaning that your programs will
  no longer be stuck behind other users' programs making HTTP or DB calls. This
  was a major source of slow Dark programs experienced by most users.

- You can now put a lambda in a variable and pipe into it.

- Better errors in many many cases, especially for bad input.

- During a deploy of the Dark service, cron jobs no longer run the risk of
  running twice.

- `String::length` is `O(1)` instead of `O(N)`

- When reading strings from a user, the string is only passed over once.

- The rewrite also addressed some underlying issues that will come out in new
  features soon, including a better type system, support for characters and
  tuples, fixes for poor behaviour in Date and String functions, and more. These
  issues are tracked in our new
  [project tracker](https://github.com/darklang/dark/projects/1#column-15173588).

## Week of 5/29/2020

- It's now possible to set a return type for functions. The return type will
  appear in the autocomplete and type errors will be displayed when necessary,
  making it easier to know that your functions work, and making it easier to use
  and understand functions. This means that your functions can also now use the
  Error Rail, if you set their return type to Result or Option.

![changelog/returntypes.png](/img/changelog/returntypes.png)

- Datastores can now have fields named id. This was contributed by our first
  external contributor, [Caleb H](https://github.com/naclcaleb)!

  in the sidebar is for, click on its name and more details will appear on the
  right side of your canvas.

![changelog/sidebar.gif](/img/changelog/sidebar.gif)

- We've done some major infrastructure work behind the Cron scheduler, which
  significantly improved its performance. You should now see all Crons,
  including those with a 1 minute interval, running on time again.

  [Made With Dark badge](https://darklang.com/docs/reference/sharing-dark) to
  your apps to establish your early Dark expertise 🎉

![changelog/badge.png](/img/changelog/badge.png)

- Clicking on a link in the sidebar will now always jump you to the correct
  place on the canvas. This was a super annoying bug that we internally referred
  to as "the dreaded positioning bug", and it is finally fixed. A blog post will
  be out describing the horror show behind this next week.
- Copying & pasting now works properly for pipes! We'll no longer lose arguments
  when copying between piped and non-piped expressions.
- Re-ordering function parameters works again. You can drag a function parameter
  to change its order (and we'll reorder the callers too).
- When you invite people (go to Settings), we'll error properly if the invite
  failed.
- When you try to access Dark in Firefox or other browsers, we'll tell you it
  won't work instead of crashing.
- You can now drag much more of a handler to move it (now including the
  docstring and return value boxes)
- When clicking on traces with errors, we'll no longer incorrectly color the
  trace dots.
- `Result::map2` and 5 other `Result` functions now goes to the error rail.
- When you press `,` to add another entry to a list, we'll now support it on
  both sides of an existing `,`.

## Week of 5/1/2020

- We now show you the exact execution path of a trace, making it easy to
  understand what happened in that trace. See which code paths are executed,
  whether `if`s return `true` or `false`, and which patterns are matched. This
  should make it much easier to understand code at a glance.

![changelog/codeexecution.gif](/img/changelog/codeexecution.gif)

- Fixed a bug that caused text to sometimes be selected in multiple handlers.
- It is now possible to drag both the return value and docstring fields on a
  handler.
- We have disabled the visual identifier for error traces, due to them turning
  all trace dots red. We plan to fix and re-enable in the future.

## Week of 4/24/2020

- We've added `Http::setCookie_v2` which handles the `expires` parameter
  properly. It also has much better error messages
- Added `Dict::member`, `Date::<=` and `Date::>=` to the standard library
- Updated a few standard library functions:
  - `String::isSubstring` is now `String::contains`
  - `List::contains` is now `List::member`
- `String::contains` is now supported in `DB::query*` functions
- It is now no longer possible to create multiple datastores with the same name.
- Fixed an issue that causes Dark to crash when selecting while the autocomplete
  was available.
- We now support recursion! While it's been supported for a long time on the
  backend, you were unable to get live values for recursive functions in the
  editor. Now you can!
- When new traces are created while your editor is open, we'll now replace old
  traces with the new one (before we added all traces, which caused large
  canvases to crash).
- We've improved the loading time of the editor for apps with lots of 404s
- Some function docstrings now link to relevant documentation - more to come!

### Documentation

- Improved the documentation around
  [setting up a custom domain](https://darklang.com/docs/custom-domains)

## Week of 4/17/2020

- Traces can now be linked to directly.
- Pasting JSON into Dark now works in more cases
- The command palette keyboard shortcut has changed: you should now use `ctrl+s`
  (we also support `alt+x`, and `ctrl+\`, should it be helpful for folks with
  non-US keyboard)
- Updated `String::slugify_v1` to slugify correctly in all cases.
- `DB::query` functions now support `String::contains` in their query block.
- The docstrings for `List::sortBy` and `List::sortByComparator` were updated to
  improve clarity.

### Documentation

- Lots of small typos and corrections were made - thank you to everyone who
  reported them!
- Improved the documentation around `match`, thanks to Nathan Lloyd Smith!
- Added a tutorial around
  [creating new Trello cards via Slack](https://darklang.com/docs/slack-apps/tutorials/new-trello-card)

## Week of 4/10/2020

- We've done a lot of work to improve how quickly we can set up custom domains -
  if you want a custom domain to point to your Dark app,
  [read the documentation](https://darklang.com/docs/custom-domains) to see how
  to do it.
- More standard library functions! We're ramping down our concentrated effort to
  add more all at once, so if you have any requests post in the
  [Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite) or email
  feedback@darklang.com
  - `Float::clamp`
  - `Int::clamp`
  - `Int::mod`
  - `Int::remainder`
  - `String::dropFirst`
  - `String::dropLast`
  - `String::first`
  - `String::last`
  - `String::trimStart`
  - `String::trimEnd`
- We've realized that people had difficulty knowing that they need traces when
  they're editing functions, so we've added some in-editor pointers to it (call
  the function from elsewhere!)

  ![changelog/functions.png](/img/changelog/Apr10/functions.png)

- We're working a lot on performance of the editor, especially when typing.
  We've optimized a lot of different parts of the app, mostly related to typing
  and changing code, some of which are 3x faster. We'll continue working on
  this.
- The Dark CLI now suggests some common problems and solutions when auth fails,
  in response to a few instances of shell string handling surprising users
- Bug fix: typing an infix operator will now always open autocomplete.
- Bug fix: `extract-variable` now works correctly with right to left selection.
- Worker names no longer allow quotes - we noticed this causing ambiguity
  between sending and receiving of messages
- Updated the return type for `db::queryOne`

### Documentation

- Added a separate section to the documentation for
  [Building Slack Apps](https://darklang.com/docs/slack-apps/slack-intro)
- Added a tutorial for
  [building a slack app that checks for new channels and posts them](https://darklang.com/docs/slack-apps/tutorials/channel-check)
- Added and documented many
  [Trello package manager functions](https://darklang.com/docs/packages#trello-package)

## Week of 4/3/2020

- We've done a redesign of the sidebar to be more consistent and prettier!

![changelog/sidebar.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/sidebar.png)

- The `add-feature-flag` option in the command palette is now context aware
- The feature flag panel is now auto-focused when adding a new feature flag
- Added an autocomplete option for `OPTIONS` in HTTP. This is especially useful
  for people doing preflight requests as part of `CORS`

![changelog/option.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/option.png)

- Made it clearer that return values apply specifically to a trace

![changelog/returntext.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/returntext.png)

- Adding a function at the start of a pipe now works properly (before this, we
  lost the first argument)
- Text selection has been reworked and should work a lot better and have fewer
  bugs. In particular, double-clicking on a function name properly selects the
  function, and selecting with the mouse now works in all cases (that we could
  find!)
- Typing "." to make a field now always works, even if the autocomplete isn't
  ready
- Bug fix: double-clicking in text boxes now keeps your cursor there
- Bug fix: in a `match` with a `Just` pattern, the variable now has the right
  type in autocomplete
- `Error:toString` has been deprecated (you can't call functions on type errors)

### Documentation

- Added a doc about how to use [CORS in Dark](https://darklang.com/docs/cors)
- Added and documented many
  [Slack package manager functions](https://darklang.com/docs/packages#slack-package)

## Week of 3/27/2020

We released a lot this week, hope you enjoy!

- We have re-released feature flags! Feature flags allow you change live code
  safely: write the new code that you want, choose the condition to use that
  code instead (just for your user? just if a header is passed? Just if a
  particular query string is provided?). Then switch to the new code or discard
  it, safely, without breaking anything.
- Feature flags can be created from the command palette.

![changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png](/img/changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png)

- The keyboard shortcut for the command palette has changed to `Ctrl-\`

![changelog/Mar27/2020-03-27_12.27.23.gif](/img/changelog/Mar27/2020-03-27_12.27.23.gif)

  - `Date::weekday`
  - `Dict::toList`
  - `Dict::fromList`
  - `Dict::filterMap`
  - `Dict::size`
  - `Dict::singleton`
  - `List::filterMap`
  - `List::map2`
  - `List::map2shortest`
  - `List::tail`
  - `List::singleton`
  - `List::unzip`
  - `List::zip`
  - `List::zipShortest`
  - `Option::map2`
  - `Result::map2`
  - `String::slice`
  - `String::padStart`
  - `String::padEnd`
- Hyphens are now allowed in records/dicts, to make it easier to set HTTP
  headers

![changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.33.06_PM.png](/img/changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.33.06_PM.png)

- `HTTP::respond` was renamed to `HTTP::response`, to make it clearer that it
  creates a value.

  functions which currently return `<Incomplete>`
- Tab now moves you to the next editable space
- Disabled a few features while we re-work them:
  - Create new function option in the autocomplete
  - Mouse over database stats

### Documentation

- Added [Your First Function](https://darklang.com/docs/first-function) and
  [Your First External API Call](https://darklang.com/docs/first-api)
- Updated the [Slack tutorial](https://darklang.com/docs/slack-app-tutorial) to
  discuss OAuth v2

## Week of 3/20/2020

- Now you can give us more information about your Dark projects, and let us know
  if they're live. This helps us understand how we can make Dark better for you!

![changelog/Mar20/about.png](/img/changelog/Mar20/about.png)

- Significantly faster HTTP requests and canvas loading. We "fixed" this a few
  weeks ago, but only saw modest improvements. Yeah, there was a bug. So now
  it's fixed fixed: some HTTP requests have dropped from 3s to 70ms.
- We've added lots of standard library functions:

  - `Float::absoluteValue`
  - `Float::negate`
  - `Float::power`
  - `Float::min`
  - `Float::max`
  - `Float::truncate`

    ![changelog/Mar20/float.png](/img/changelog/Mar20/float.png)

  - `Int::negate`
  - `Int::absoluteValue`
  - `Dict::isEmpty`
  - `String::isEmpty`

## Week of 3/13/2020

### Features

- We now tell you how to deal with the ErrorRail in the docstrings for functions
  that returns `Options` and `Results`

![changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png)

- We've started narrowing down the types in the autocomplete using types, and we
  now have some nice error messages for options which don't match the types

![changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png)

- `DB::query` (and other `DB::query` functions) now support `Date` operations
- Performance: We've improved the load speed of your code on our servers by
  about 3x over the last few weeks, with the final change landing this week.
  This has the largest impact when loading the editor as all of your code loads
  then (though it is also less noticeable there as the JS overhead is higher
  than the DB overhead so 🤷🏽‍♀️)
- We have launched an alpha
  [package manager](https://darklang.com/docs/packages), which allows re-using
  Dark functions from other users or canvases. Today, only Dark employees can
  add functions to the package manager. We've started with some commonly used
  Slack functions, but let us know via Slack or email if you have any requests -
  or your own functions you'd like to share.

![changelog/Mar13/slackfunctions.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/slackfunctions.png)

    elsewhere)
- The command palette's documentation appears properly (press `ctrl-\` to show
  the command palette)

- We now give better error messages when you try to use `Int` functions (like
  `+` and `-`) on `Floats` or `Strings`

![Float addition showing error message](/img/changelog/Mar6/floaterror.png)

- When you try to use invalid canvas names (e.g. with capital letters), we now
  error much better
- When backspacing function names, we now delete the version automatically,
  which makes it clearer what's being deleted.

## Week of 2/28/2020

  - New variables now correctly display their type instead of Incomplete.
  - Autocomplete now appears correctly for single-character variables.
  - It was possible to get into a state where your variable was not added to
    autocomplete - this is no longer possible.

  cause text to the right of the deletion point to be removed.

![changelog/image2.gif](/img/changelog/image2.gif)

- We asked y'all to not make HttpClient calls to your Dark canvas from REPLs.
  We've made some infrastructural changes that fix the issue on our end, so you
  should feel free to do that now. This is useful if you want to create a HTTP
  trace without leaving Dark. (Note: please don't make HttpClient calls **_to
  Dark_** from HTTP handlers)

## Week of 1/10/2020
