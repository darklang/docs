## Darklang Release 3 (July 1, 2022)

Darklang Release 3 is focused primarily on taking advantage of the recent
changes, including new stdlib functions, small languages changes, and sunsetting
old features.

## Language improvements

- When a function is called with a runtime error as an argument, return the
  runtime error instead of a new error
  ([#4095](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4095)). This was a significant
  source of annoyance for devs trying to figure out why their code wasn't
  working.

- 64bit ints now work end-to-end (previously we had two separate issues with
  numbers above `2^53` and numbers above `2^63`)
  ([#4209](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4209))

## Stdlib improvements

- Allow `HttpClient::basicAuth_v0` and `HttpClient::basicAuth_v1` to run in the
  editor ([#4147](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4147))

- Allow `Crypto::sha256_v0`, `Crypto::sha384_v0` to run in the editor
  ([#4146](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4146))

- rename `String::toInt` to `Int::parse_v0`, making it work for 64 bit ints
  (previous version only supported 63-bit ints)
  ([#4191](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4191))

- add `List::all` ([#4150](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4150))

- Mark `Date::today` as impure
  ([#4149](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4149))

- Add new versions of Date functions `Date::hour_v1`, `Date::minute_v1`, and
  `Date::second_v1`, which unlike the previous versions do not return negative
  results for dates before 1970!
  ([#4133](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4133))

- Rename the `f` parameter of functions using first-class functions to `fn`
  ([#4156](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4156),
  [#4150](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4150))

- Use camelCase in all standard library parameters
  ([#4201](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4201))

- Fix typos and poor wording in a lot of error messages and functions
  descriptions ([#4096](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4096),
  [#4200](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4200))

## Editor improvements

- Fix using secrets when run in the editor
  ([#4128](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4128),
  [#4129](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues/4129))

- Fix occasional crash in editor analysis
  ([#4117](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4117),
  [#4098](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4089),
  [#4070](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4070))

- Remove the old (OCaml-based) analysis, reducing the size of the editor
  download and speeding up startup
  ([#4148](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4158))

- Remove the canvas minimap which was causing a long hang when switching to edit
  functions ([#4106](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4106))

## Http Framework improvements

- Load programs faster by removing 3-4 fewer DB requests during load
  ([#4051](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4051))

## Internal improvements

- Make the Dark repo build on Mac with M1/M2 (arm) chips
  ([#4237](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4237)).

- Remove a lot of old OCaml code
  ([#4140](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4140),
  [#4138](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4138),
  [#4195](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4195),

  [#4074](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4074),
  [#4225](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4225))

- Remove all Rust from the codebase
  ([#4057](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4057))

- Remove all Go from the codebase
  ([#4039](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4039))

- Refactor the client (Rescript) codebase
  ([#4199](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4199),
  [#4203](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4203),
  [#4206](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4206),
  [#4218](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4218),
  [#4220](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4220))

- Many steps to speed up the CI/CD pipeline

- Remove unused DarkInternal functions
  ([#4056](https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/4056))

## Darklang Release 2 (June 6th, 2022)

Darklang Release 2 is the culmination of 20 months work of rewriting the backend
from OCaml to F#. This was done to give us more productivity by allowing us use
more 3rd party SDKs, to solve operational issues, and to make it easier to
contribute. Our reasons for making the change were discussed at the time:
[1](https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/),
[2](https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/),
[3](https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/).

- The editor backend was fully migrated by April 2nd.
- HTTP backends (for builtwithdark.com) were finished converting on May 3rd.
- The migration to the new queues was fully converted on May 27th.
- The execution engine in the editor was switched over on June 5th.

The change was documented in a series of blogposts:
[1](https://blog.darklang.com/hows-the-dark-rewrite-going/),
[2](https://blog.darklang.com/changes-the-the-dark-rewrite/),
[3](https://blog.darklang.com/optimizing-tasks-in-fsharp/),
[4](https://blog.darklang.com/benchmarking-fsharp6-tasks/),
[5](https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-year-in-review-2021/),
[6](https://blog.darklang.com/try-out-the-new-darklang-backend/), and

### Major changes

- Darklang's implementation is now asynchronous, meaning that your programs will
  no longer be stuck behind other users' programs making HTTP or DB calls. This
  was a major source of slow Dark programs experienced by most users.

  As well as massively reducing latency for programs written in Dark, the editor
  now loads much faster.

  We have also switched from dozens of tiny machines to a smaller number of much
  more powerful machines. This makes your programs run faster on average, even
  when accounting for the switch to an asynchronous implementation.

- You can now put a lambda in a variable and pipe into it.

- Most error messages are improved, especially for bad input.

- The queues have been rewritten and should not longer suffer from the old
  sources of occasional downtime and slow-down.

- During a deploy of the Dark service, cron jobs no longer run the risk of
  running twice.

- There is now a [Status page](https://status.darklang.com).

- Dark's internal firewalls have been significantly improved

- Several bottlenecks to outbound HTTP requests have been identified and removed

- `String::length` is now `O(1)` instead of `O(N)`

- JSON output is now significantly faster

- When reading strings from a user, the string is only passed over once.

- Traces are now stored in the background, after a request has completed,
  greatly reducing response time on HTTP requests to Dark programs.

- Dark has moved to more powerful cloud machines, going from Google' Cloud's
  deprecated N1 machines to extremely powerful T2D machines (2.3x faster)

- The rewrite also addressed some underlying issues that will come out in new
  features soon, including a better type system, support for characters and
  tuples, fixes for poor behaviour in Date and String functions, and more. These
  issues are tracked in our new
  [project tracker](https://github.com/darklang/dark/projects/1#column-15173588).

#### Error messages

All error messages have been renovated, attempting to make them more consistent
and to reuse error message machinery. As a result, a majority of Dark error
messages have changed. If you were relying on the explicit format of a Dark
language or stdlib error message, expect that it will be different.

If you do any error handling which relies specifically on the text of an error
message coming from Dark, we recommend you no longer do that, and just use the
presence of the error instead of the text.

There are two places in Dark which use string error messages:

##### `Result.Error`s

The `Error` enum (referred to as `Result.Error` below for clarity), will contain
a string error in most cases, which you might be using directly or indirectly.

You might be accessing `Result.Error`s and their text contents directly using
the `match` statement.

You might also be accessing their text contents indirectly, using `toString`, or
other stringifying functions, such as `toString`, `JSON::` functions and
`HTTPClient::` functions. This is only true if you taken the function returning
the `Result.Error` off the error rail. This text may also make it to your
web/mobile clients or API consumers.

`Result.Error`s returned via a HTTP handler are not presented to the user, so
text cannot leak that way.

##### Runtime errors

Runtime errors (including type errors) are not accessible via Dark programs, and
will always terminate the Dark program when they are accessed. As a result, the
text of any runtime error should not be accessible to your programs or your
users.

### Minor improvements and fixes

- Dark used to return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in lower-case, it
  is now returned in mixed case.

- When making a web request to your Dark application, if you did not specific a
  'user-agent' header, Dark used to add a 'user-agent' header of
  'ocaml-cohttp/1.2.0'. We no longer add this header.

- When making a web request to your Dark application with a 'content-type'
  header of "text/ping", Dark used to ignore the code and immediately return a
  response of status code 418. It now processes the request instead.

- `HttpClient::*` functions called with usernames and passwords in the url can
  now support arbitrary UTF8 (in the past, Unicode was not supported.)

- `X509::pemCertificatePublicKeys` used to only work for RSA keys. It now also
  supports DSA and ECDsa keys. The old version would read ECDsa keys and return
  an incorrect answer - it now returns a correct answer.

- `String::split` would fail if the 2nd argument was `""` and the first argument
  was a complex Unicode character, such as `String::split "👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍👩‍👧‍👦🏳️‍⚧️‍️🇵🇷" ""`.
  This is now split correctly.

- `String.trim`, `String::trimEnd` and `String::trimStart` worked incorrectly in
  some Unicode situations, they now work correctly.

### Breaking changes

These breaking changes were documented and announced many months in advance of
switching over to the new version of Darklang. We also very careful deployed the
new code, watching for suspisious changes in any Dark programs that were
running. In the rare case where something went awry, we contacted the users and
worked with them to ensure a seamless transition.

#### String casing

- `String::toLowercase_v0` and `String::toUppercase_v0` worked correctly in the
  old version of Dark, for all unicode. In the new version, the library we are
  using does not correctly handle some case changes, instead keeping the
  original character. This happens when the replacement is a different length
  than the character being replaced (for example, `"և"` should be `"ԵՒ"` when
  converted to upper case, which the old version did correctly and the new
  version does not). We plan to fix this at a later point.

#### String ordering

- Functions whose output relies on the internal ordering of a `Dict` may have
  different outputs, specifically, the output Lists may be in a different order.
  Examples include `Dict::keys`, `Dict::values`, and `Dict::toList` which return
  `List`s of values which are ordered based on the internal ordering in the
  original `Dict`.

- When calling `List::uniqueBy`, and there is a duplicate, the new version of
  Dark may pick a different value for the duplicate. For example:

```dark
List.uniqueBy_v0 [1;2;3;4] (fun x -> Int.divide_v0 x 2) = [ 1, 3, 4 ] // old Dark
List.uniqueBy_v0 [1;2;3;4] (fun x -> Int.divide_v0 x 2) = [ 1, 2, 4 ] // new Dark
```

#### Http Clients

- `HttpClient::*` functions no longer support making requests with arbitrary
  `Content-Type`s. They must now be
  [valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type),
  for example `"application/json"` or `"application/json; charset=utf-8"`.

#### Generating JSON

We have changed how JSON is generated in many cases. All the JSON generated by
Dark is now standards compliant, and uses a different formatting style.

In the old version of Dark, we would generate invalid JSON for the Float values
`NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity`. The old version of Dark generates them as
bare identifiers, while the new version puts them in a string (eg `NaN` vs
`"NaN"`).

This may occur in any of the places in which we generate JSON, which are:

- when responding to a HTTP request in the HTTP framework
- when making a request with HttpClient (any version)
- when calling any of:
  - `Dict::toJson_v0`
  - `Object::toJson_v1` (_deprecated_)
  - `Object::toJson_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `Twilio::sendText_v1`
  - `Twilio::sendText_v0` (_deprecated_)

Note that the following `JWT` functions do not use this new behaviour, and
should have the exact same behaviour as before, including:

- `JWT::signAndEncode_v0` (_deprecated_)
- `JWT::signAndEncode_v1`
- `JWT::signAndEncodeWithHeaders_v0` (_deprecated_)
- `JWT::signAndEncodeWithHeaders_v1`

#### Parsing JSON

When parsing JSON, we no longer accept the following invalid JSON:

- bare field names, such as in `{ id : 5 }`. You need to quote field names:
  `{ "id": 5 }`
- newlines and invalid bytes in JSON strings
- the bare identifiers `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are no longer parsed
  into valid floats (note that the old version of Dark might have generated JSON
  with these values in it)

Dark now also allows parsing 64-bit integers (as opposed to 63-bit integers
before).

Dark parses JSON:

- when receiving a HTTP request in the HTTP framework
- when receiving a response to a request made with HttpClient (any version)
- when calling any of:

  - `JSON::parse_v1`
  - `JSON::parse_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `JSON::read_v0` (_deprecated_)
  - `JSON::read_v0` (_deprecated_)

Note that `JWT::verifyAndExtract_v0` and `JWT::verifyAndExtract_v1` are not
affected by this change, as they have been kept deliberately compatible with the
old versions.

#### HTTP stack

Dark has switched to using Kestrel, a high-performance HTTP server from .NET,
for its HTTP server. There are some differences between the new Kestrel-based
server and the previous OCaml `cohttp`-based server:

Large differences:

- Dark programs can no longer set the HTTP `Content-Length` header and it will
  be set automatically. A `Content-Length` header will be ignored if provided
  via `Http::response` or similar functions.

- Dark is now less lenient to receiving incorrect `Content-Length` headers. If
  the data sent does not match the expected `Content-Length`, the HTTP server
  will return a 400 Bad Request error. Omitting the `Content-Length` header is
  still OK.

- JSON returned from HTTP requests is now formatted differently, as discussed
  above.

Minor differences:

- When making HTTP requests to Dark:
  - Clients must send at least 256 bytes every 5 seconds or be timed-out
  - All headers must be sent in first 10 seconds
  - There must be fewer than 100 headers and they must fit in 32KB
  - The maximum size of HTTP requests to Dark is 10MB
- Http responses sent by Dark
  - Headers will be returned in a different order
  - Headers are not always lowercase anymore
  - The `Date` header is now always present
  - The `Server` header is now `darklang` and always present

### Testing changes

We have gone from about 250 backend tests to over 5,000. We now have custom test
frameworks for:

- [language and standard library testing](https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/tests/testfiles)

- [Http server testing](https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/tests/httptestfiles)

- [Testing Http clients](https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/tests/httpclienttestfiles)

- [Fuzz testing](https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/tests/FuzzTests)

- [Integration tests](https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/integration-tests)
  were ported to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), from TestCafe. They now
  run much faster and are somewhat easier to write.

### Operational changes

Behind the scenes, Dark has greatly improved its operations.

- Switched to massively more powerful servers (requests now get 2 CPUs of a
  [Google Cloud T2D](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/compute-engine-tau-t2d-vms-now-available-for-scale-out-workloads),
  vs 0.1 CPUs of a n1d -- T2Ds are about 2.3x more powerful than N1Ds)

- Separated the servers used by the Darklang editor from the ones running
  production applications.

- Massively increased use of [observability](https://honeycomb.io) and error
  tracking to catch errors and customer issues

- Moved queues from running in the database (often taking over 50% of the CPU,
  to relying on our cloud vendor (Google PubSub). Also greatly increased
  reliability of the queues.

- Nodes are now autoscaled, leading to significant cost savings.

- Updated to latest version of kubernetes, cert-manager (which powers our
  [custom domains](https://docs.darklang.com/how-to/custom-domains) feature),
  nginx, and other tools that we use.

- Added internal [feature flagging](https://launchdarkly.com) to give us more
  control over how our infrastructure runs in production

- Significantly increased use of kubernetes' security features, in particular
  internal firewalls.

- Standardized our production deployment process using a tool we wrote called
  [shipit](https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/8082df91676de2f26a0661bf20827a60976bb3c0/scripts/deployment/shipit)

- Removed nginx from our builtwithdark.com backends

- Move migrations out from startup code

- All certs except darksa.com and darkstaticassets.com are now managed
  automatically

### Documentation changes

- moved docs to docs.darklang.com
- [refactored docs](https://github.com/darklang/docs/pull/220) to use the Divio
  documentation system, categorizing all docs into Tuotials, Reference, How-tos,
  Walk-throughs and Discussion.

## Week of 6/12/2020

- Secrets are now available! Now you can store API keys, passwords and other
  sensitive information separately from the rest of your canvas. Secrets will
  appear in autocomplete in handlers across your entire canvas. They will appear

## Week of 5/29/2020

- It's now possible to set a return type for functions. The return type will
  appear in the autocomplete and type errors will be displayed when necessary,
  making it easier to know that your functions work, and making it easier to use
  and understand functions. This means that your functions can also now use the
  Error Rail, if you set their return type to Result or Option.

![changelog/returntypes.png](/img/changelog/returntypes.png)

- Datastores can now have fields named id. This was contributed by our first
  external contributor, [Caleb H](https://github.com/naclcaleb)!

## Week of 5/22/2020

- We've added more information to the sidebar! If you're not sure what a section
  in the sidebar is for, click on its name and more details will appear on the
  right side of your canvas.

![changelog/sidebar.gif](/img/changelog/sidebar.gif)

- We've done some major infrastructure work behind the Cron scheduler, which
  significantly improved its performance. You should now see all Crons,
  including those with a 1 minute interval, running on time again.
- Return values and execution fade are no longer stale when taking functions
  on/off the
  [error rail](https://docs.darklang.com/discussion/error-handling#error-rail)

- We've added a Hello World tutorial that will show automatically for new
  accounts. It can also be accessed via the avatar menu.

![changelog/helloworld.png](/img/changelog/helloworld.png)

- [Package manager functions](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages) and
  their underlying code can now be accessed via the sidebar. These functions
  will appear in the autocomplete, and can be used like any other built-in
  function.

![changelog/packagemanager.png](/img/changelog/packagemanager.png)

- It's now easier to add 404s to your canvas - the entire line is now clickable,
  instead of just the plus sign.
- Made a ton of small fixes to feature flags:
  - The correct docstring now shows when a feature flag is selected
  - Feature flag expressions now show the correct live value
  - Feature flags are now correctly created after pressing `Cmd+a` to select
    everything.
  - Feature flags no longer incorrectly display the "code was not run executed
    in this trace" error message.

  page to the
  [Building Slack Apps](https://docs.darklang.com/category/walk-throughs)
  section.

## Week of 5/8/2020

- We now have Dark badges for your sites! Add a
  [Made With Dark badge](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/sharing-dark) to
  your apps to establish your early Dark expertise 🎉

![changelog/badge.png](/img/changelog/badge.png)

- Clicking on a link in the sidebar will now always jump you to the correct
  place on the canvas. This was a super annoying bug that we internally referred
  to as "the dreaded positioning bug", and it is finally fixed. A blog post will
  be out describing the horror show behind this next week.
- Copying & pasting now works properly for pipes! We'll no longer lose arguments
  when copying between piped and non-piped expressions.
- Re-ordering function parameters works again. You can drag a function parameter
  to change its order (and we'll reorder the callers too).
- When you invite people (go to Settings), we'll error properly if the invite
  failed.
- When you try to access Dark in Firefox or other browsers, we'll tell you it
  won't work instead of crashing.
- You can now drag much more of a handler to move it (now including the
  docstring and return value boxes)
- When clicking on traces with errors, we'll no longer incorrectly color the
  trace dots.
- `Result::map2` and 5 other `Result` functions now goes to the error rail.
- When you press `,` to add another entry to a list, we'll now support it on
  both sides of an existing `,`.

## Week of 5/1/2020

- We now show you the exact execution path of a trace, making it easy to
  understand what happened in that trace. See which code paths are executed,
  whether `if`s return `true` or `false`, and which patterns are matched. This
  should make it much easier to understand code at a glance.

![changelog/codeexecution.gif](/img/changelog/codeexecution.gif)

- Fixed a bug that caused text to sometimes be selected in multiple handlers.
- It is now possible to drag both the return value and docstring fields on a
  handler.
- We have disabled the visual identifier for error traces, due to them turning
  all trace dots red. We plan to fix and re-enable in the future.

## Week of 4/24/2020

- We've added `Http::setCookie_v2` which handles the `expires` parameter
  properly. It also has much better error messages
- Added `Dict::member`, `Date::<=` and `Date::>=` to the standard library
- Updated a few standard library functions:
  - `String::isSubstring` is now `String::contains`
  - `List::contains` is now `List::member`
- `String::contains` is now supported in `DB::query*` functions
- It is now no longer possible to create multiple datastores with the same name.
- Fixed an issue that causes Dark to crash when selecting while the autocomplete
  was available.
- We now support recursion! While it's been supported for a long time on the
  backend, you were unable to get live values for recursive functions in the
  editor. Now you can!
- When new traces are created while your editor is open, we'll now replace old
  traces with the new one (before we added all traces, which caused large
  canvases to crash).
- We've improved the loading time of the editor for apps with lots of 404s
- Some function docstrings now link to relevant documentation - more to come!

### Documentation

- Improved the documentation around
  [setting up a custom domain](https://docs.darklang.com/how-to/custom-domains)
- Added a tutorial around
  [creating new Asana projects and tasks via Slack](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-asana)

## Week of 4/17/2020

- Traces can now be linked to directly.
- Pasting JSON into Dark now works in more cases
- The command palette keyboard shortcut has changed: you should now use `ctrl+s`
  (we also support `alt+x`, and `ctrl+\`, should it be helpful for folks with
  non-US keyboard)
- Updated `String::slugify_v1` to slugify correctly in all cases.
- `DB::query` functions now support `String::contains` in their query block.
- The docstrings for `List::sortBy` and `List::sortByComparator` were updated to
  improve clarity.

  reported them!
- Improved the documentation around `match`, thanks to Nathan Lloyd Smith!
- Added a tutorial around
  [creating new Trello cards via Slack](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-trello)

## Week of 4/10/2020

- We've done a lot of work to improve how quickly we can set up custom domains -
  if you want a custom domain to point to your Dark app,
  [read the documentation](https://docs.darklang.com/how-to/custom-domains) to
  see how to do it.
- More standard library functions! We're ramping down our concentrated effort to
  add more all at once, so if you have any requests post in the
  [Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite) or email
  feedback@darklang.com
  - `Float::clamp`
  - `Int::clamp`
  - `Int::mod`
  - `Int::remainder`
  - `String::dropFirst`
  - `String::dropLast`
  - `String::first`
  - `String::last`
  - `String::trimStart`
  - `String::trimEnd`
- We've realized that people had difficulty knowing that they need traces when
  they're editing functions, so we've added some in-editor pointers to it (call
  the function from elsewhere!)

  ![changelog/functions.png](/img/changelog/Apr10/functions.png)

- We're working a lot on performance of the editor, especially when typing.
  We've optimized a lot of different parts of the app, mostly related to typing
  and changing code, some of which are 3x faster. We'll continue working on
  this.
- The Dark CLI now suggests some common problems and solutions when auth fails,
  in response to a few instances of shell string handling surprising users
- Bug fix: typing an infix operator will now always open autocomplete.
- Bug fix: `extract-variable` now works correctly with right to left selection.
- Worker names no longer allow quotes - we noticed this causing ambiguity
  between sending and receiving of messages
- Updated the return type for `db::queryOne`

### Documentation

- Added a separate section to the documentation for
  [Building Slack Apps](https://docs.darklang.com/walk-throughs/slack-app)

![changelog/sidebar.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/sidebar.png)

- The `add-feature-flag` option in the command palette is now context aware
- The feature flag panel is now auto-focused when adding a new feature flag
- Added an autocomplete option for `OPTIONS` in HTTP. This is especially useful
  for people doing preflight requests as part of `CORS`

![changelog/option.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/option.png)

- Made it clearer that return values apply specifically to a trace

![changelog/returntext.png](/img/changelog/Apr3/returntext.png)

- Adding a function at the start of a pipe now works properly (before this, we
  lost the first argument)
- Text selection has been reworked and should work a lot better and have fewer
  bugs. In particular, double-clicking on a function name properly selects the
  function, and selecting with the mouse now works in all cases (that we could
  find!)
- Typing "." to make a field now always works, even if the autocomplete isn't
  ready
- Bug fix: double-clicking in text boxes now keeps your cursor there
- Bug fix: in a `match` with a `Just` pattern, the variable now has the right
  type in autocomplete
- `Error:toString` has been deprecated (you can't call functions on type errors)

  [Slack package manager functions](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages#slack)

## Week of 3/27/2020

We released a lot this week, hope you enjoy!

- We have re-released feature flags! Feature flags allow you change live code
  safely: write the new code that you want, choose the condition to use that
  code instead (just for your user? just if a header is passed? Just if a
  particular query string is provided?). Then switch to the new code or discard
  it, safely, without breaking anything.
- Feature flags can be created from the command palette.

![changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png](/img/changelog/Mar27/Screen_Shot_2020-03-27_at_12.44.20_PM.png)

  if they're live. This helps us understand how we can make Dark better for you!

![changelog/Mar20/about.png](/img/changelog/Mar20/about.png)

- Significantly faster HTTP requests and canvas loading. We "fixed" this a few
  weeks ago, but only saw modest improvements. Yeah, there was a bug. So now
  it's fixed fixed: some HTTP requests have dropped from 3s to 70ms.
- We've added lots of standard library functions:

  - `Float::absoluteValue`
  - `Float::negate`
  - `Float::power`
  - `Float::min`

- We now tell you how to deal with the ErrorRail in the docstrings for functions
  that returns `Options` and `Results`

![changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/errorrail.png)

- We've started narrowing down the types in the autocomplete using types, and we
  now have some nice error messages for options which don't match the types

![changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png](/img/changelog/Mar13/autocomplete.png)

- `DB::query` (and other `DB::query` functions) now support `Date` operations
- Performance: We've improved the load speed of your code on our servers by
  about 3x over the last few weeks, with the final change landing this week.
  This has the largest impact when loading the editor as all of your code loads
  then (though it is also less noticeable there as the JS overhead is higher
  than the DB overhead so 🤷🏽‍♀️)
- We have launched an alpha
  [package manager](https://docs.darklang.com/reference/packages), which allows
  re-using Dark functions from other users or canvases. Today, only Dark
  employees can add functions to the package manager. We've started with some
  commonly used Slack functions, but let us know via Slack or email if you have
  any requests - or your own functions you'd like to share.

- When you try to use invalid canvas names (e.g. with capital letters), we now
  error much better
