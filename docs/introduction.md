Darklang is an integrated language, framework, and editor for building web
backends: REST API endpoints, asynchronous background workers, scheduled jobs,
and persistent storage. Darklang's framework is tightly coupled to the
infrastructure, and as you write code you're able to develop from real incoming
requests/traces.

## Hello World

![Hello World](/img/helloworld.gif)

Above, you can see how to create a simple Hello World application in Darklang.
Starting with an empty canvas in the Darklang editor, it creates a HTTP endpoint
(`GET /hello`), and adds code (`"Hello world"`) to return a response. That
endpoint is immediately
[available in the cloud](https://ellen-helloworld3.builtwithdark.com/hello).
