Let's start by using the editor to write an API endpoint that responds to a
browser HTTP request.

1. To create a new HTTP endpoint, we first bring up the omnibox, by clicking
   anywhere on the screen, pressing `Cmd-k`/`Ctrl-k`, or pressing the plus next
   to `HTTP` on the sidebar.

2. Enter the HTTP method `GET`, and the HTTP route `/math`.

3. You can now write any code in the blank &ndash; this is the return value of
   the API endpoint that you've just created. To start with, let's just return
   `4`.

4. Click the handler's menu (â˜°) in the upper right and select "open in new tab",
   to see your API endpoint running in production.

5. Go back to Darklang to edit your code. Add `+ 5` to the end of the code and
   leave your cursor in line.

- The `9` below the handler shows you the return value for the handler.

- The `5` on the left shows you the result of the expression where the cursor
  currently is (in this case, 5). This isn't very useful when it's an integer,
  but if it's a variable it will show you the result of the variable.

6. Hover your mouse over the white dots on the left. Each dot is a "trace",
   representing a single request to your handler. Traces are fundamental to
   coding in Darklang, and we'll come back to them later.

Congratulations! You've now created (and deployed) a HTTP endpoint on Darklang.
