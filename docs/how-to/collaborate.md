title: How to collaborate with other developers
---

Darklang supports multiple developers editing the same canvases.

## Create a new organization to collaborate in

To collaborate, you will need a new organization, whose canvases you will all be
able to edit.

To request an organization, send a DM to Paul Biggar in
[the Darklang Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite). Please include:

- your username
- the organization username you'd like
- the usernames of any other users you'd like added

All users will be admins, and will be able to add more users to the organization
later.

## Give another user access to an organization

Any user who has access to an organization can request another user be added.

To add a user to your organization, send a DM to Paul Biggar in
[the Darklang Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite). Include your
username, and their username.

## Give a user access to your canvases

You can allow another users access to your canvases. Note that this is a very
broad permission, they gain access to every one of your canvases, not just one.
In most cases, creating a new organization is more appropriate.

To add a user to your canvases, send a DM to Paul Biggar in
[the Darklang Discord](https://darklang.com/discord-invite). Include your
username, and their username.
