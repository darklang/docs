### Support

We provide support via the [Dark Community
Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer questions,
often within minutes. Lots of experienced community members are also around to
offer helpful suggestions.

You can also send us feedback or ask questions via
[email](mailto:feedback@darklang.com). We answer every email we are sent.
